# Rasmus's build of st

This is based on Lukes ST fork

- Added extra key combinations for zoom and copy paste
- Copy/Paste shift + ctrl + c/v

## Luke's additions

The [suckless terminal (st)](https://st.suckless.org/) with some additional features:

- Compatibility with `Xresources` and `pywal` for dynamic colors.
- Default [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colors otherwise.
- Transparency/alpha, which is also adjustable from `~/.Xresources`.
- Default font is system "mono" at 16pt, meaning the font will match your system font.
- Very useful keybinds including: + Copy is alt-c, paste is alt-v or alt-p pastes from primary selection + Alt-l feeds all urls on screen to dmenu, so they user can choose and
  follow one (requires xurls and dmenu installed). + Zoom in/out or increase font size with Alt+Shift+k/j or u/d for larger intervals. + Hold alt and press either ↑/↓ or the vim keys k/j to move up/down in the termgit@github.com:RasmusKoit/st.gitinal. + Shift+Mouse wheel do the same. + Alt-u and Alt-d scroll back/forward in history a page at a time. + Alt-PageUp and Alt-PageDown will do the same.
- Vertcenter
- Scrollback
- updated to latest version 0.8.1

The following additional bindings were added before I forked this:

- Scroll through history -- Shift+PageUp/PageDown or Shift+Mouse wheel
- Increase/decrease font size -- Shift+Alt+PageUp/PageDown
- Return to default font size -- Alt+Home
- Paste -- Shift+Insert

## Installation for newbs

```
make
sudo make install
```

Obviously, `make` is required to build. `fontconfig` is required for the default build, since it asks `fontconfig` for your system monospace font. It might be obvious, but `libX11` and `libXft` are required as well. Chances are, you have all of this installed already.

On OpenBSD, be sure to edit `config.mk` first and remove `-lrt` from the `$LIBS` before compiling.

Be sure to have a composite manager (`xcompmgr`, `compton`, etc.) running if you want transparency.

## How to get link dmenu to work

Get the latest [xurls](https://github.com/mvdan/xurls/releases/latest)
Download binary and save it to `/usr/local/bin/`

```
wget -O xurls https://github.com/mvdan/xurls/releases/download/v2.0.0/xurls_v2.0.0_darwin_amd64
sudo mv xurls /usr/local/bin/xurls
```

## How to configure dynamically with Xresources

For many key variables, this build of `st` will look for X settings set in either `~/.Xdefaults` or `~/.Xresources`. You must run `xrdb` on one of these files to load the settings.

For example, you can define your desired fonts, transparency or colors:

```
*.font:	Liberation Mono:pixelsize=12:antialias=true:autohint=true;
*.alpha: 150
*.color0: #111
...
```

The `alpha` value (for transparency) goes from `0` (transparent) to `255`
(opaque).

### Colors

To be clear about the color settings:

- This build will use gruvbox colors by default and as a fallback.
- If there are Xresources colors defined, those will take priority.
- But if `wal` has run in your session, its colors will take priority.

Note that when you run `wal`, it will negate the transparency of existing windows, but new windows will continue with the previously defined transparency.
